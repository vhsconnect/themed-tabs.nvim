MOTIVATION                                            *themed-tabs-motivation*

I found myself getting lost and disorganized when I was working with many tabs
at once especially when each tab is further broken down into a set of panes. By
color coding each tab I can switch contexts that little bit faster and keep
focus.


SETUP                                                      *themed-tabs-setup*

This plugin must be explicitly enabled and a list of `colorschemes` must be
passed in the configuration by using `require("themed-tabs").setup{
colorschemes }`. Neovim will throw errors when you switch tabs if these are not
set.


USAGE                                                      *themed-tabs-usage*

Just create new tabs and switch between them as you usually would. The theme is
set per tab number so closing a tab will cause all your tabs to shift one
colorscheme to the left.


CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS                  *themed-tabs-caveats-and-limitations*

The default `colorscheme` set in your configuration will take precedent over
the first colorscheme in the plugin’s configuration when opening Neovim. Once
you cycle back to the first tab however the plugin’s first theme is applied.
That’s why it’s a good idea to match those two themes.


DEVELOPMENT                                          *themed-tabs-development*

Append the path to the plugin’s `init.lua` to your `package.path`

>lua
    `package.path = package.path .. ';/path/to/themed-tabs.nvim/lua/themed-tabs/init.lua'`
